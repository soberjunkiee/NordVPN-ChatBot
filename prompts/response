  "response": "Got it — let’s troubleshoot your Android connection to a Canadian server.\n\nFirst, a quick check:\nAre you seeing any specific error message when trying to connect (e.g., “Authentication failed”, “Unable to connect”, or a timeout)?\n\nIn the meantime, here are a few quick steps that often fix this on Android:\n\n1. Change the VPN protocol\n   - Open NordVPN app → Settings → VPN protocol\n   - Switch to NordLynx (or try OpenVPN – TCP if NordLynx is already selected)\n\n2. Reconnect to a different Canada location\n   - Try Canada #xx, Toronto, or Vancouver options if available.\n\n3. Clear the VPN tunnel\n   - Toggle Airplane Mode ON, wait 5 seconds, then turn it OFF.\n\n4. Restart the app session\n   - Fully close the app → reopen → try connecting again.\n\n5. Check if another VPN/Firewall app is active\n   - If yes, disable it temporarily — it may block the VPN tunnel.\n\nLet me know the exact error you’re seeing and we can pinpoint the issue even faster."
